# love-mapcell
A partially-random map engine for Love2D

## Why???
I spent money on Tilesetter and wanted to make use of it, and all the Tiled implementations broke for me. Basically it takes the JSON output of Tilesetter and draws based off of that.

This is nowhere near done, I just got something functional that can draw pictures based off of the output so it's going on here

## Requirements
lunajson + cargo
